# sPHENIX Tile Tester
Stand for holding and testing tiles that will be placed in the sPHENIX Hadronic calorimter detector. 

## Frame
The frame is designed from 2020 extruded aluminum. It uses angle brackets and only two lengths, 1000mm and 300mm. This results in a lightweight and easily configurable mount that can even be shipped as a kit. This also provides a more inexpensive solution. The fouse lies on reducting the number of custom machined parts which alos has the added benifit of reduced lead times and easier replacement parts.

The area allocated is set up to house all 24 styles of tiles. The tiles locate against the wall of uprights, once aligned the SiPMs can be aligned to them. Height and number of tiles is determined by electronics but no more than 32 is recomended.
